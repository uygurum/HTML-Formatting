            <br><br>
            &#128073; In HTML , for example , the < h1> element is a semantic element , which gives the text it wraps around
                the role ( or meaning ) of " a top level heading on your page . "
                <br><br>
                <mark>&#x25BA; Here is a top level heading</mark>
                <br><br>
                &#128073; By default , most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an < h1> with a large font size to
                    make it look like a heading ( although you could style it to look like anything you wanted ) . On
                    the other hand , you could make any element look like a top level heading .
                    <br><br>
                    <mark>&#x25BA; Consider the following</mark>
                    <br><br>
                    &#8688; his will render it to look like a top level heading , but it has no semantic value , so it will
                    not get any extra benefits as described above . It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML
                    element for the right job .
                    <br><br>
                    &#8688; HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default
                    presentation styling . Presentation ( how it should look ) , is the sole responsibility of CSS .

                    without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
                <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
                <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element / component naming</li>

            &#x2B50; <mark>( Search Engine Optimization )</mark> is the process of making a website more visible in search results ,
            also termed improving search rankings.
            <br><br>
            &#x2B50; Search engines <strong>crawl</strong> the web , following links from page to page , and index the content found . When you
            search , the search engine displays the indexed content . Crawlers follow rules . If you follow those rules
            closely when doing SEO for a website , you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first
            results , increasing traffic and possibly revenue <i>( for ecommerce and ads )</i>  .
            <br><br>
            &#x2B50; Search engines give some guidelines for SEO , but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret
            . SEO combines official search engine guidelines , empirical knowledge , and theoretical knowledge from
            science papers or patents .
